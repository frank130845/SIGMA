## ðŸš€ Introduction
**SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo Augmentation)** is a novel framework that leverages *sibling nodes* in Monte Carlo Tree Search to refine the reasoning trajectories of large language models (LLMs).  
Instead of discarding non-optimal branches, SIGMA reintegrates them via **critique** and **revision**, significantly boosting reasoning accuracy with far fewer samples.
