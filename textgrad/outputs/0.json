  "question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?",
  "refined_cot": "Revised reasoning:\n- If Natalia sold half the number of clips in May as she did in April, she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May. \n\nTo determine the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May, add the number of clips sold in April to the number sold in May: 48 + 24 = 72 clips. \n\nTherefore, Natalia sold 72 clips in total in April and May.",

  "textgrad_feedback": "The best path provided is mostly correct and logically sound. However, there is one minor issue that can be clarified for better precision:\n\n- The statement \"she sold half as many clips in May\" can be slightly ambiguous. It would be clearer to explicitly state that Natalia sold half the number of clips in May as she did in April. This clarification helps ensure that the reader understands the comparison being made.\n\nOther than that, the reasoning is clear, and the steps are logically connected. The calculation and conclusion are accurate based on the information given in the problem."
