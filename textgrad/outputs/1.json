  "question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?",
  "refined_cot": "Revised reasoning:\n- Next step:\nSince Weng earns $12 per hour, we can calculate how much she earns for 50 minutes by setting up a proportion. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can set up the proportion:\n\n$12 / 1 hour = X / 50 minutes\n\nSolving for X, we get:\nX = ($12 / 1 hour) * 50 minutes / 60 minutes\n\nX = $10.00\n\nTherefore, Weng earned $10.00 for 50 minutes of babysitting.",

  "textgrad_feedback": "The best path provided is a correct and efficient way to solve the problem. However, there is a minor error in the calculation of the final answer.\n\nCritique of the best path:\n1. The setup of the proportion is correct and a valid approach to solving the problem.\n2. The conversion of 50 minutes to hours by setting up the proportion is accurate.\n3. The calculation to find the amount earned for 50 minutes is correct up to the point of multiplying by 50 minutes and dividing by 60 minutes.\n4. The final calculation should be as follows:\nX = (12 dollars / 1 hour) * 50 minutes / 60 minutes\nX = $10.00\n\nThe correct final answer should be $10.00, not $10 as stated in the best path."
